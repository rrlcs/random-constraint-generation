Dataset Generation

# The 4 main files:
1. main.cpp: Can generate dataset with or without grammars. the without grammar part is fast. With or without grammar by commenting out the code.
2. expressionAst.h: main.cpp uses it to generate expressions.
3. constraint-generator.py: grammar based constraint generator. Main calls this only.
4. generate-dataset.sh: Root script
